# Frontend Mentor Challenge

This repo is based on the [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io) free projects.

## Restart my journey in tech.
### Learn by doing
As I have promised myself to restart my journey into tech, frontend development is my first step. I have started doing Javascript 30 but it is never better than doing projects, I realize I do not have great design ideas for landing pages, therefore, I am challenging myself by doing Frontend Mentors projects.
I am picking up the HTML, CSS, Javsascript skills, along with WebAPIs technology to build great looking themes and webpages, these are the proper challenges I am giving myself.

Challenge 1: [Interactive Rating Component](https://dazzling-cocada-deb4f9.netlify.app/interactive-rating-component-main/)
Challenge 2: [Single Price Grid Component](https://dazzling-cocada-deb4f9.netlify.app/single-price-grid-component-master/)
