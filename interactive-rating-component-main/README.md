## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

- Vanilla Javascript

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

How to center the div, transition, the font size, and how to show shades of blues, as a developer focuses on scripting this has been quite challenging for to me pick up CSS again, it was a great warm-up project using the frontend core technologies.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

There are some logic can be improved and I would like to have some animation with the card changing, rotation or rise from the bottom.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**
